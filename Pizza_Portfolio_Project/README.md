Portfolio Project: Pizza DB

Made in: Quick DBD & MYSQL & Looker studio

Fictional Task:
New Pizza Store is running takeout and delivery business. 
The owner requires to design and build relational database that allow him to capture and store all of important 
information and data that the business generates. This will help him to monitor business performance in dashboards

Clients wants to know:
Customer orders information
When itâ€™s time to order new stock
Which staff members are working when
The staff salary information

My Approach:
1. Design and built mock-up 
2. Collect and normalize the data 
	- I created fictional data - see .cvs in folder
3. Define the table relationships and create relational database 
	- [see here](PizzaDB.sql) or [graphics here](relational_database.png)
4. Create all queries in SQL 
	- see [orders_query](QUERY/Dashboard_1_orders_query.txt),[stock_query1](QUERY/Dashboard_2_stock_query1.txt),[stock_query2](QUERY/Dashboard_2_stock_query2.txt),[staff_query](QUERY/Dashboard_3_staff_query)
5. Visualize dashboards in Looker studio 
	- [see here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/12682c81-25b5-40e9-9856-e93422b88a84)
