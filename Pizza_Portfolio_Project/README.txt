Fictional Task:
New Pizza Store is running takeout and delivery business. 
The owner requires to design and build relational database that allow him to capture and store all of important 
information and data that the business generates. This will help him to monitor business performance in dashboards

Clients wants to know:

Which staff members are working when
The staff salary information

My Approach:

2. Collect and normalize the data 
	- I created fictional data - see .cvs in folder
3. Define the table relationships and create relational database
