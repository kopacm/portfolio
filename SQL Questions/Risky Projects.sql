"Identify projects that are overbudget. A project is overbudget if the prorated cost of all employees assigned to it exceeds the projectâ€™s budget.
To determine this, prorate each employee's annual salary to match the project's duration. For example, if a project with a six-month duration has a budget of $10,000.
Output a list of overbudget projects with the following details: project name, project budget, and prorated total employee expenses (rounded up to the nearest dollar).
Hint: Assume all years have 365 days and disregard leap years."
